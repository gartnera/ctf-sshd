ctf-sshd allows easily running capture the flag (CTF) challenges in docker containers. The user will be allowed to login to the `ctf` user with no prompt!

I use it with [container-spawner](https://github.com/gartnera/container-spawner) which creates an ephemeral docker container for each TCP connection.
